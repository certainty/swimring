SwimRing
========

SwimRing is our final project for Fault Tolerant Computing course in NCTU. The main goal is to build a minimal **distributed** **fault-tolerant** key-value store with *SWIM Gossip Protocol* and *Consistent Hash Ring*. The project is implemented in Go, and many of design and architecture are adapted from [Uber](http://www.uber.com)'s open source project - [Ringpop](https://github.com/uber/ringpop-go).

The project is still under construction.
